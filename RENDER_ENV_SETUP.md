# Setting Environment Variables on Render.com

## Fix Missing JWT_SECRET Environment Variable

The error in your deployment log indicates that the application is failing to start because the JWT_SECRET environment variable is missing. Here's how to fix it:

1. Go to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click on your `quizlet-flashcard-api` service
4. Navigate to the "Environment" tab
5. Add or update the following environment variable:
   - **Key**: `JWT_SECRET`
   - **Value**: (Generate a secure random string)

You can generate a secure random string using one of these methods:
```bash
# Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Using OpenSSL
openssl rand -hex 32
```

6. Click "Save Changes" - this will automatically redeploy your application with the new environment variable

## Important Notes:

- Make sure the JWT_SECRET is the same across all environments if you're running multiple instances
- Render.com may already have a `JWT_SECRET` generated as shown in your render.yaml file:
  ```yaml
  - key: JWT_SECRET
    generateValue: true
  ```
  However, it seems this value is not being properly applied. Check if it's set properly in the environment settings.

- If you're using the `JWT_SECRET` generated by Render, you'll need to view it in the Environment variables section and use the same value for local development.

## After Setting Environment Variables

Once you've added the JWT_SECRET, monitor the deployment logs to ensure the application starts successfully. The error about "Missing required environment variables: JWT_SECRET" should no longer appear.
