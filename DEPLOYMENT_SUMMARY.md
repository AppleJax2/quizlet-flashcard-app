# Deployment Summary

## What We've Fixed

1. **Package Dependencies**:
   - Moved `mongodb-memory-server` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`
   - Downgraded to version 7.6.0 for Node.js 16 compatibility

2. **Dockerfile Updates**:
   - Updated to install all dependencies instead of just production ones
   - Configured to use Node.js 16

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Improved the database loader to properly handle both development and production modes
   - Added proper environment checks

## Deployment Process

### 1. Frontend (Netlify)

Your frontend is deployed on Netlify and should automatically update when you push to GitHub. The deployment URL is:
```
https://lustrous-tartufo-9102a1.netlify.app
```

**To verify deployment**:
1. Check the Netlify dashboard for deployment status
2. Visit your site and test functionality
3. Check browser console for any API connection errors

### 2. Backend (Render.com)

Your backend is deployed on Render.com and should automatically update when you push to GitHub. The API URL is:
```
https://quizlet-flashcard-api.onrender.com
```

**Critical Steps Before Deployment**:
1. Configure a proper MongoDB database (see RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
2. Ensure the MongoDB URI environment variable is set correctly
3. Make sure all other environment variables are configured

**To verify deployment**:
1. Check the Render dashboard for deployment status
2. Test the API health endpoint: `/health`
3. Test authentication endpoints
4. Check logs for any errors

## Testing the Deployed Application

1. Register a new user
2. Log in with the new user
3. Create a flashcard set
4. Test processing endpoints
5. Test that protected routes require authentication

## Potential Issues

1. **CORS**: If you encounter CORS errors, verify the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` setting includes your frontend URL
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Make sure your MongoDB Atlas instance is accessible from Render.com
3. **Environment Variables**: Check that all required environment variables are properly set
4. **Cold Starts**: Free tier services on Render may have cold starts; the first request might be slow
